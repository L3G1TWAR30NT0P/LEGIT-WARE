This is Legit Hub (LH) V2. No fluff, no filler—just pure dominance. If you're looking for an apology for how hard this hits, go somewhere else.

LEGIT HUB (LH) V2: RELEASE NOTES
The Rebrand: Legit Ware is Dead.
We’ve evolved. Legit Hub (LH) is the new standard. It’s cleaner, faster, and more lethal. If you’re still using the old version, you’re already behind.

THE LOADOUT: WHAT’S NEW
ESP REBORN: We’ve stripped the garbage. No more screen-cluttering boxes or neon trash. You get high-fidelity, clinical intel. You see them; they don't see you. Simple.

AIMBOT V2: Re-coded for perfection. We’ve killed the robotic snapping. This is smooth, human-like tracking that deletes enemies before they can even react. It doesn't just aim; it hunts.

ADVANCED PREDICTION: Stop chasing shadows. Our prediction engine puts your crosshair where the enemy will be. By the time they move, they’re already dead.

ZERO PERFORMANCE TAX: Most hubs eat your frames. LH runs silent and optimized. Zero FPS drop. We’re lightweight; the competition is bloated garbage.

UI DESTRUCTION: Get the menu out of your way. One click and it’s gone. Total immersion. Total focus. Total casualties.

FRIEND & TEAM LOGIC: Don’t be a clown. Our logic ensures you never lock onto a teammate. Keep your "legit" reputation while you stack bodies.

PLAYER SEARCH: No one is anonymous. No one is hidden. Find your targets instantly and systematically.

THE BOTTOM LINE
Other players "grind." You dominate.
Other players "guess." You already know.

If you want a flashy cheat to show off to your friends, go find a cheap hub. If you want to stay silent, stay clean, and make the entire server salty because they can't figure out how you're so good—LH V2 is the only answer.

Stop playing fair. Start winning.
